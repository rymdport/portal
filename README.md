# Portal

Portal is a Go wrapper around the [XDG Desktop Protocol](https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/) D-Bus API.
This allows the code to request information from the user through the help of the desktop environment even when running inside a sandbox like Flatpak.  
As such, it is possible to easily open file dialogs, links and send notifications to the user in a way that integrates well with the desktop environment.

When running inside a sandbox, this runtime request of permissions allows the code to do various things without having to grant more permissions to the sandbox.
However, the portal APIs should still also work good even when used outside of a sandboxed environment.

The goal of this project is to be a toolkit agnostic package for accessing these interfaces through Go code without needing to access [libportal](https://github.com/flatpak/libportal) through CGo.

## API

The api of this Go module is designed to closely follow the structure naming of the upstream APIs. This means, in practice, that each D-Bus interface is implemented as its own package here.
As such, it is also very useful to look at the API Reference for the protocol: https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/docs/api-reference.html

Documentation for this module and all of its packages can be found on pkg.go.dev: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rymdport/portal

The version of this module's API is still in a `v0.X.Y` state and is subject to change in the future.
A release with breaking changes will increment X while Y will be incremented when there are minor bug or feature improvements.

## Example

The following example showcases how a file chooser can be opened for selecting one or more files.


```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/rymdport/portal/filechooser"
)

func main() {
	options := filechooser.OpenFileOptions{Multiple: true}
	files, err := filechooser.OpenFile("", "Select files", &options)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(files)
}
```
